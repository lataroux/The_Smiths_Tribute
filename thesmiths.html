                    <p>The Smiths are known for their fusion of different genres. blending elements of post-punk, indie rock, and 1960s pop for a timeless sound. Morrissey's introspective, melancholic lyrics apired with Marr's intricate guitar work set the band apart from other rock bands at the time. They became a symbol of alienation and individuality, and a beacon of hope to people who also struggled to conform to societal standards. Their songs tackled themes of loneliness and heartbreak, societal and political issues, and identity struggles, often layered with irony and satire.</p>
